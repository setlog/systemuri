# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue.

This project uses [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) to set some style rules. If your IDE does not support it natively, please install [a plugin](https://editorconfig.org/#download).

## Pull Request Process

1. Make sure to update `CHANGES.md` to list your changes. For non-release commits, add a heading
   of the form `## x.y.z (TBD)` under which to add your changes.
2. When changing, adding or removing functionality (i.e. anything other than bug-fixes and improving
   code quality) make sure to reflect this in the documentation under `docs/`.
3. Before committing anything, make sure the following call of `golangci-lint` reports no problems:
   `golangci-lint run --enable-all --disable stylecheck --disable gochecknoglobals --disable gochecknoinits --disable lll --disable gocritic --disable dupl --disable golint --disable gofmt --disable goimports ./...`

## Branches

Main release branch: **main** (protected, default)
  - Finished features, fixes etc. are merged into this branch
  - If possible, it should at any time build and pass tests
  - Tags can be used for test releases and should be distinct from existing version tags
  - Tags starting with v+Number will create full releases, incl. docker images

Maintenance branches: **maint-A.B.x** (protected)
  - Where A and B are a specific version, and 'x' is used in the branch name to indicate which that the patch level is being maintained in this branch.

Feature-, bugfix and development branches:
  - Any other branch

## Development cycle

Development takes place on **main**. It should always build and any larger features should be done in feature branches.
If there are maintenance branches, each feature should be backported to a maintenance-branch.
Releases are tagged using v+[SemVer](https://semver.org/). E.g.: `vX.Y.Z`

To create a release for the latest version:
  * Finish all pending changes to master
  * Make sure CHANGES.md is complete and has the correct publication date and version number
  * Check if pipeline succeeds - should always be the case!
  * Make a release through [the release-overview of the project's GitHub page](https://github.com/setlog/systemurl/releases), creating a new tag on the latest `main`. Tag should be `vX.Y.Z`, title should be `vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)` and message should be the markdown-formatted list of fixes, features and changes from `CHANGES.md`.
  * Prepare the CHANGES.md with a new (TBD) entry.

Alternative to creating a tag without a release page entry:
```
git tag "vX.Y.Z"
git push origin "vX.Y.Z"
```

To create a release for a maintenance version, do not merge it into `main`. Instead, tag the release on the maintenance branch.
